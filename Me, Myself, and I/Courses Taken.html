<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>I enjoy most of my classes as during the class it isn't hard but something I don't like is the quizzes since they can be hard to study for and I sometimes have no idea what to study. The classes that are preparing me for my major are General Chemistry and the Lab part of it since it's showing the base of what my major is about.</p>
