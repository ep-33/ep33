<h2>About me</h1>
<p>Emiliano Perea, currently attending Saint Mary's College of California. Alongside that, I am currently a first year and majoring in Biochemistry. A few things I like to do for fun is playing video games, traveling to places, going on drives during the night, messing around with computers, and listening to music.</p>
