<h1>Personal Interests</h1>
    <dl>
        <dt><b>Video Games</b></dt>
        <dd>I enjoy playing video games whenever I'm stressed or just bored. Some video games I play are <em>Ark: Survival Evolved</em>, <em>COD: Black Ops III Zombies</em>, <em>COD: Modern Warfare III</em>, <em>Gran Turismo 7</em>, and <em>Terraria</em>.</dd>
	<dt><b>Driving</b></dt>
	<dd>Going out for night drives and long drives in genenral is something I very much love doing. I love doing this whenever I'm with people that I'm really close with since it makes the drive so much more intersting. I also enjoy the lights at night time and how the stars come out and overall it just makes me feel calmer with the cold air.</dd>
	<dt><b>Musical Intruments</b></dt>
	<dd>Some instruments I personally play are the saxophone and acoustic bass since I love the noises from these intruments and it enlightens me to hear them in other songs as well.</dd>
	<dt><b>Cooking/Baking</b></dt>
	<dd>I enjoy both cooking and baking since I love eating food. I've always been trying to make food that is cooked by my mom which is mostly traditional mexican dishes. My favorite thing to cook is enchiladas and I love to bake both cake and brownies as well.</dd>
